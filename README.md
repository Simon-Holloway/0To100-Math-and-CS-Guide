# The 0 To 100 Math and CS Guide



# Intro:
   This course assumes you know literally nothing about math and computer science, and also assumes you want to become a great mathematician and computer scientist. To get started just go to the math and computer science sections down below; there is an intro for each section.

   I spent this year gathering the best courses and books I could find, shortening the list to what I think are only the necessities, and now I’m publishing it here. The goal of this guide is to become a competent mathematician and computer scientist as fast as possible while leaving nothing out. However long this takes will be up to you and your schedule; I have no timeframes. 

   I did try my best to keep costs low and look for books with widespread availability. These books are not free, but will for sure cost less than a college education.

   I gutted these guides to make this one;

   [/sci/ Wiki](https://4chan-science.fandom.com/wiki/Mathematics)
   
   [Open Source University](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science)
   
   [MIRI](https://intelligence.org/research-guide/)
   
    
   All are worth checking out for more options / other choices of books / other tangential fields of knowledge. /sci/ being the most helpful.

   Other useful ideas for studying are in this [study guide](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bjjbp5i5G8bekJuxv/study-guide)

   Don't get lost finding the perfect guide or book or course. You can look occasionally but if you spend more time looking at courses than you do studying you are just distracting youself.

   I also intent for this to a very alive document, changing to get better resources and better reflect the best way to become competent in the ML field. I don't want this to be an abandonded guide that becomes less helpful as time goes on.
   
# General tips:

   
   Buy older editions of the book, usually they are MUCH cheaper and are not missing too much, although some are worth it for the new addition. Use your discretion.
      
   Don't worry about doing all the problems in a text book, just select a few to do and move on.
   
   You don't need to know everything in a book or course usually. 
   If something seems extraneous in a book you can try skipping it and coming back to it if needed. Use your discretion. 
      
   Set yourself a goal for X amount of work a day. 10 pages a day will get a 500 page textbook done in under two months! Consistency is key.
   
   Don't worry if it's hard to study at first, think of your brain as a muscle that gets stronger the more you train it. 
   Just keep trying and be realistically consistent.
    
    
# Math:
   **How to go through math:**
   Start with Pre-Calc
       
   Then go through Calc vol 1.
   
   Then do Calc vol 2, Applied Linear Algebra, and Applied Statistics at the same time.

   PDE (Partial Differential Equations) book, and information theory in the Machine Learning section if you are planning on going that route.


   In some sections I found both books and good online courses that help add to the material.
   I found that the online material has more hand holding practice problem which is very helpful, and lectures by professors which are also somewhat helpful. If there is both videos and books, I would read a portion of the book, then also do the corresponding amount of lecture and problems.
   The sections won't match and the book will be much more indepth than the videos, but don't worry it will all come around. However what has worked for me might not for you, as always you yourself will need to find the path of least resistance than still brings competency that works for you, which will take time. 



**Pre-Calculus**
If you have been out of school for a while I highly suggest going to [Kahn Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math), starting at algebra 1 or further back if you need it, and working your way up through pre-calculus. It will make your life much easier than just diving into calc (which I did and it didn't work well, because I didn't have a good foundation).


    Don’t watch the videos, they are too long.
    Just do the test problems on the side and learn what you're supposed to do if you get the problems wrong.
    Don't go for perfection, getting 3 out of 4 problems right and moving on to the next sub-unit is fine. 
    Do the unit tests if you feel like it.

**Calculus**

 Calculus is the study of small changes and the accumulations of those small changes which is very useful for understanding the world,
 The tools given in these books  also gives you the ability to go into probability theory and linear algebra.
      

   Calc Single Variable (also known as calc 1 & 2):

   Book:

   [Integration](https://www.edx.org/course/calculus-1b-integration?index=product&queryID=78bba3add81064bca5e4085a161d3544&position=4)

   Multivariate (calc 3):

   Sadly MIT has only made part 1 for multivarite calc on their edX platform so far. 
   
   MIT does offer multivarite integration with their open courseware linked below, you can just skip differentiation if you did the edX course (which I recommend doing). Multivariate Integration will come up in probability and statistics, so make sure you know it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Applied Linear Algebra:**

   Linear algebra gives great tools for working with large amounts of data.
   A good chunk of computer research relies on linear algebra and it is essentially the cornerstone of ML along with Probability.

    Linear Algebra and Its Applications by Strang
    
   
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Probability and Statistics:**

   The study of randomness and probability is useful for everything in life since we live in an uncertain world.

   Book:
    Mathematical Statistics with Applications 7th Edition by Dennis Wackerly

 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    

**Partial Differential Equations (PDE):**

   PDE's are used in CS for optimization and ML for algorithms, it has many uses in other fields as well.

  Intro to PDE's


    Applied Partial Differential Equations: With Fourier Series and Boundary Value Problems by Haberman
    
       
    
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   

**Moving forward**:
    If you just can’t get enough math, the next best areas to explore would most likely be abstract algebra to group theory, and [Convex Optimizations](https://see.stanford.edu/Course/EE364A). Plus any other areas of that that interest you in the other guides at the top. 
   
   
   
# Computer Science:
   **How to go through comp-sci:**
       
   Learn coding from the C++ website while reading combinatorics and graph theory. Then start working through the data structures and algorithms book while also learning python syntax. Read theory of computation and systems design, then move on to ML.

   Most of what is available for you to learn in computer science will be bottlenecked by your understanding of math, so do put in a good amount of your study time (however long you set for yourself) there, combinatorics and graph theory included.


 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   

**Start off learning C++**

   The best entry into coding I have found so far. Every chapter is well-explained and concise.
   It has a nice balance between exercises and learning, 
   showcases best practices for the industry and is useful for beginners and experienced coders.
   
   Go up through chapter 12 then start on python programming if wanting to do ML.


   [C++](https://www.learncpp.com/)
   


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Learning Python**

   The nice thing about learning one programming language is that learning another is basically just finding out what you can or can't do.
   
   [A Whirlwind Tour of Python](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/python-notes/a-whirlwind-tour-of-python-2.pdf)
    
   Python is the main programming language for data science and ML/AI. It is very important that you know your way around it.
   If you wish to stick to traditional CS and only code in c++ you don't have to learn it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
       
**Algorithms and Data structures**

   A good introduction into data structures and algorithms using the c++ language. Data structures and algorithms are used to make programs fast which also make them useful. While ML / AI has their own algorithms it’s useful to understand algorithm analysis and how to manipulate data. 

    Algorithms in C++ Parts 1-5: Fundamentals, Data Structures, Sorting, Searching, and Graph Algorithms by Sedgewick

   

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Combinatorics and Graph Theory**

   Combinatorics and Graph theory are the main types of math used in computer science. 
   Most algorithms and ways to manipulate data come from the insights found in those fields.

  Combinatorics
    
    Combinatorics: Topics, Techniques, Algorithms by Peter J. Cameron

       
  Graph Theory
      
    Graph Theory (Graduate Texts in Mathematics) 5th ed by Reinhard Diestel


   

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Theory of computation**

   What can computers do? What can’t they do? This book introduces some of the answers to those questions through math. 
   It's useful for things like understanding how complexity analysis came to be and why it’s important. 

    Introduction to the Theory of Computation by Sipser



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



**Systems design**
    
   Systems design is how to make big applications, how to scale from 1 user to 1000 users to 1 million + users. 
   Having some idea of how you create a reliable and scalable system is very useful for anybody who wants other people to use their code or data.


   For people that want to know systems design basics:

   [Grokking the System Design Interview](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview?aff=Bayg)

   Or 
    
   For people who want more comprehensive systems design knowledge:

    Designing Data-Intensive Applications: The Big Ideas Behind Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Systems by Martin Kleppmann 
    

# Machine / Deep Learning:
  **Once you have gone through multivariate calc, linear algebra, probability, c++, and know python syntax you can start ML.**
  It would be helpful to have worked through a PDE book.
  
  **How to go through ML:**
   Read Python Data Science Handbook and Hands-On Machine Learning at the same time, read some popular ML papers and start working on your own projects.
   Use the interview guidebook to get an idea of how to get into companies. 

   If there is an online course treat it the same as the math section and do them both simultantiously.
   
   There is no set path from there, the rest is up to you to figure what sub-area to be in and how to make your projects work through many hours of trial and error.
   But I hope this guide helped you become well prepared for that. Best of luck with future projects!

   **Getting started in python data science**
   
   Book:
    
    Python Data Science Handbook: Essential Tools for Working with Data

   Online:
   
    
   [Python for Data Science](https://www.edx.org/course/python-for-data-science-2)
   
     
   Gets you comfortable with IPython, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, 
   which are the main tools used to represent and manipulate data in python.  
   
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     
   **Getting caught up in machine learning**
   
    Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools,
    and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems, 2nd Edition by Aurélien Géron

   A deep dive into the ML field.  Covers most used, common algorithms and topics in both machine learning and deep learning. 
   A great way to get a working view of what the field currently offers. 
   
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  
  **Information Theory**
  Information Theory is designed to answer the question of how data is transferred system-to-system without losing quality. 
  It is also useful for knowing how data can be manipulated in ML systems without losing its quality as well.
 
    Information Theory (Dover Books on Mathematics) by Ash
    
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 

**Projects**

After getting caught up in machine / deep learning you should (will need to) work on some projects before you are able to be seen as hirable. You should decide what you want to do and focus on a sub area; NLP? Computer vision? Then get some data sets and work to make a project that seems interesting to you. I will be putting good websites for datasets down below; at the top is Kaggle which has good datasets and also offers competitions from companies (with money prizes). I would go there first.  

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    
**ML Interviews**

[Introduction to Machine Learning Interviews Book](https://huyenchip.com/ml-interviews-book/)

   This is a great guide for people wanting to get a machine learning job in companies large or small. 
   It goes over different job types, timelines, and interview questions. It seems comprehensive and well thought out.
    

   

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Useful Data Science Websites**

   [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) is a great place for datasets and competitions, ignore their courses.
