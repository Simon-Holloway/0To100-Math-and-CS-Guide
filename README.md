# The 0 To 100 Math and CS Guide



# Intro:
   This course assumes you know literally nothing about math and computer science, and also assumes you want to become a great mathematician and computer scientist. To get started just go to the math and computer science sections down below, there is an intro for each section.

   I spent this year gathering the best courses and books I could find, shortening the list to what I think are only the necessities, and now I’m publishing it here. The goal of this guide is to become a competent mathematician and computer scientist as fast as possible while leaving nothing out. However long this takes will be up to you and your schedule, I have no timeframes. 

   I did try my best to keep costs low and look for books with widespread availability. These books are not free, but will for sure cost less than a college education.

   I gutted these guides to make this one,

   [/sci/ Wiki](https://4chan-science.fandom.com/wiki/Mathematics)
   
   [Open Source University](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science)
   
   [MIRI](https://intelligence.org/research-guide/)
   
    
   All are worth checking out for more options / other choices of books / other tangential fields of knowledge.
   
   /sci/ and MIRI being the most helpful.
   
# General tips:

   
   Buy older editions of the book, usually they are MUCH cheaper and are not missing too much, some are worth it for the new addition. Use your discretion.
      
   Don't worry about doing all the problems in a text book, just select a few to do and move on.
   
   You don't need to know everything in a book or course usually, 
   if something seems extraneous in a book you can try skipping it and coming back to it if needed. Use your discretion. 
      
   Set yourself a goal for X amount of work a day. 10 pages a day will get a 500 page textbook done in under two months! Consistency is key.
   
   Don't worry if it's hard to study at first, think of your brain as a muscle that gets stronger the more you train it. 
   Just keep trying and be realistically consistent.
    
    
# Math:
   **How to go through math:**
   
   Start with proofs, set theory, and precalc at the same time.
       
   Then go through calc and probability at the same time.

   Then do applied linear algebra, first PDE book, and information theory in the ML section if you are planning on going that route.

   Finish with the last PDE book.




   **Required:**

**Pre-Calculus**
If you have been out of school for a while I highly suggest going to [Kahn Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math), starting at algebra 1 or further back if you need it, and working your way up through pre-calculus. It will make your life much easier than just diving into calc (which I did and it didn't work well because I didn't have a good foundation).


    Don’t watch the videos, they are too long, 
    just do the test problems on the side and learn what your supposed to do if you get the problems wrong.
    its also good to think about why what your learning is useful and try thinking about how you can apply it real life.
   
   
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Proofs:**

   Proofs are used everywhere in mathematics to literally prove what is possible and impossible,
   it will come up very often in these books so it is vital to know how to read and make your own proofs.


    How to Prove It: A Structured Approach by Velleman
    
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Intro Set theory**
       
 Cornerstone of mathematics along with proofs, will show up many many times.
 
    Elements of Set Theory by Enderton
      
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
**Calculus**

 Calculus is the study of small changes and the accumulations of those small changes which is very useful for understanding the world,
 The tools given in these books  also gives you the ability to go into probability theory and linear algebra.
      

   Calc Single Varite (also known as calc 1 & 2):


    Calculus, Vol. 1: One-Variable Calculus, with an Introduction to Linear Algebra by Apostol
    

   Multivariate (calc 3):

   
    Calculus, Vol. 2: Multi-Variable Calculus and Linear Algebra with Applications to Differential Equations and Probability by Apostol
    

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Applied Linear Algebra:**

   Linear algebra gives amazing tools to make solving complex problems easier,
   a good chunk of computer research relies on linear algebra and it essecially the cornerstone of ML along with Probability.

    Linear Algebra and Its Applications by Strang
    
   
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Probability and Statistics:**

   The study of randomness and probably is useful for everything in life since we live in an uncertain world.
   Implemented into ML systems it gives rise to the impressive pattern matching we see in things like GPT-3.

    Probability and statistics Book by Morris H. DeGroot
    
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    

**Partial Differential Equations (PDE):**

   PDE's are used to in CS for optimization and ML for algorithms, there are many useful PDE in other fields as well.

  Intro to PDE's


    Applied Partial Differential Equations: With Fourier Series and Boundary Value Problems by Haberman
    
       
  Rigorous PDE's   
   
   
    Partial Differential Equations by Evans
    
    
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   

**Moving forward**:
    If you just can’t get enough math the next best areas to explore would most likely be abstract algebra to group theory, then random signals and noise.
   
   
   
# Computer Science:
   **How to go through comp-sci:**
       
   Learn coding from the C++ website while reading combinatorics and graph theory. Then start working through the data structures and algorithms book while also learning python syntax. Read theory of computionation and systems design, then move on to Traditional CS or ML.

   Most of what is available for you to learn in computer science will be bottlenecked by your understanding of math, so do put in a good amount of your study time (however long you set for yourself) there, combinatorics and graph theory included.


 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   

**Start off learning C++**

   The best entry into coding I have found so far. Every chapter is well explained and concise,
   It has a nice balance between exercises and learning, 
   showcases best practices for the industry and is useful for beginners and experienced coders.


   [C++](https://www.learncpp.com/)
   


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Learning Python**

   The nice thing about learning one programming language is that learning another is basically just finding out what you can or can't do.
   That being said the learning python book is exhaustive, it will teach you many things,
   but after learning from the C++ site just skim the syntax and look at any other chapters that interest you. I also linked a more brief site to learn syntax from, and a style guide for best python practices (from google).

    Learning Python, 5th Edition by Mark Lutz

    Or
   
    https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/

   [Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)
    
   Python is the main programming language for data science and ML/AI, it is very important you know your way around it.
   if you wish to stick to traditional CS and only code in c++ you don't have to learn it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
       
**Algorithms and Data structures**

   A good introduction into data structures and algorithms using the c++ language. Data Structures and algorithms are used to make programs fast which also            make them useful. While ML / AI has their own algorithms it’s useful to understand algorithm analysis and how to manipulate data. 

    Algorithms in C++ Parts 1-5: Fundamentals, Data Structures, Sorting, Searching, and Graph Algorithms by Sedgewick

   

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Combinatorics and Graph Theory**

   Combinatorics and Graph theory are the main types of math used in computer science, 
   most algorithms and ways to manipulate data came from the insights found in those fields.

  Combinatorics
    
    Combinatorics: Topics, Techniques, Algorithms by Peter J. Cameron

       
  Graph Theory
      
    Graph Theory (Graduate Texts in Mathematics) 5th ed by Reinhard Diestel


   

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Theory of computation**

   What can computers do? What can’t they do? This book introduces some of the answers to those questions through math. 
   It's useful for things like understanding how complexity analysis came to be and why it’s important. 

    Introduction to the Theory of Computation by Sipser



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



**Systems design**
    
   Systems design is how to make big applications, how to scale from 1 user to 1000 users to 1 million + users. 
   Having some idea of how you create a reliable and scalable system is very useful for anybody who wants other people to use their code or data.


   For people doing the ML path that want to know systems design basics:

   [Grokking the System Design Interview](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview?aff=Bayg)

   Or 
    
   For people going the Traditional CS path who need more comprehensive systems design knowledge.:

    Designing Data-Intensive Applications: The Big Ideas Behind Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Systems by Martin Kleppmann 
    


# Traditional CS Path:

Not required for Machine Learning. While I won’t spend too much time on this section as it isn’t my interest, if you wanted a job in software engineering and wanted to learn some more usual CS stuff these resources seem useful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**How computers work**

   Knowing a bit about computer architecture and OS systems seems interesting, while they are both specialties of their own and mastery of them is   
   a long road, having a look into how they work isn’t harmful.

# Machine / Deep Learning:
  **Once you have gone through multivariate calc, linear algebra, probability, c++, and know python syntax you can start ML.**
  It would be helpful to have worked through a PDE book.
  
  **How to go through ML:**
   Read Python Data Science Handbook and Hands-On Machine Learning at the same time, read some popular ML papers and start working on your own projects.
   Use the interview guidebook to get an idea of how to get into companies. 
   
   There is no set path from there, the rest is up to you to figure what sub-area to be in and how to make your projects work through many hours of trial and error.
   But I hope this guide helped you become well prepared for that, best of luck with future projects!

   A great way to get a working view of what the field currently offers. 
   
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  
  **Information Theory**
  Information Theory is designed to answer the question of how data is transferred system to system without losing quality. 
  It is also useful for knowing how data can be manipulated in ML systems without losing its quality as well.
 
    Information Theory (Dover Books on Mathematics) by Ash
    
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 

**Projects**

After getting caught up in machine / deep learning you should (will need to) work on some projects before you are able to be seen as hirable. You should decide what you want to do and focus on a sub area, NLP? Computer vision? Then get some data sets and work to make a project that seems interesting to you. I will be putting good websites for datasets down below, at the top is kaggle which has good datasets and also offers competitions from companys (with money prizes). I would go there first.
