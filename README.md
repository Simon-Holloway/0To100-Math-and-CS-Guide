# The 0 To 100 Math and CS Guide



Intro:
    Having seen a lot of courses online for self studying now, I can confidently say most suck. Mainly speaking of MOOCs here, most I have seen are too verbose (to me) while lacking in practical applications, they start at too much of an entry level and don’t go too far in depth to be useful. They also seem to hang around beginner level which makes it hard wondering where to go to advance. 

   So I spent this year gathering the best courses and books I could find, shortening the list to what I think are only the necessities, and now I’m publishing it here. The goal of this guide is to become a competent mathematician and computer scientist as fast as possible while leaving nothing out. 

   I did try my best to keep costs low and look for books with widespread availability. These books are not free, but costs should be lower than $400 for everything.

   I gutted these guides to make this one, 

   /sci/Wiki
   Open Source University
   MIRI
    
   All are worth checking out for more options / other choices of books, /sci/ and MIRI being the most helpful.
    
    
#Math:
    How to go through math:
    
   Start with proofs, set theory, and precalc at the same time.
        
   Then go through calc and probability at the same time.

   Then do applied linear algebra, first PDE book, and real analysis at the same time.

   Finish with the last PDE book.




   Required:

Up to Calculus
If you have been out of school for a while I highly suggest going to Kahn Academy, starting at algebra 1 or further back if you need it, and working your way up through pre-calculus. It will make your life much easier than just diving into calc. 

   -tip: don’t watch the videos, they are too long, just do the test problems on the side and learn what your supposed to do if you get the problems wrong.

Proofs:

   How to Prove It: A Structured Approach by Velleman

Intro Set theory
    Elements of Set Theory by Enderton

Calc
        Single Varite (also known as calc 1 & 2):

Calculus, Vol. 1: One-Variable Calculus, with an Introduction to Linear Algebra by Apostol

Multivariate (calc 3):
    
Calculus, Vol. 2: Multi-Variable Calculus and Linear Algebra with Applications to Differential Equations and Probability by Apostol


Applied Linear Algebra:

   Linear Algebra and Its Applications by Strang 


Probability and Statistics:

   Probability and statistics Book by Morris H. DeGroot

Partial Differential Equations (PDE):

   Before Real analysis:

   Applied Partial Differential Equations: With Fourier Series and Boundary Value Problems by Haberman 
        
   After Real analysis:
        
   Partial Differential Equations by Evans
        

Real analysis:

   Zorich's Mathematical Analysis I & II
    

Moving forward:
    If you just can’t get enough math the next best areas to explore would most likely be number theory, abstract algebra to group theory, and random signals and noise.
    
    
#Comp-Sci
    How to go through compsci:
        
   Linearly focus on the C++ course to data structures and then algorithms. Once you have taken the C++ course and learned the data structures, take a python course to learn syntax. You should also implement what you learn in the algorithms book into python as well. 

   Most of what is available for you to learn in computer science will be bottlenecked by your understanding of math, so do put in a good amount of your study time (however long you set for yourself) there.

   Once you have made it a good way through how to prove it you can start reading theory of computation, you can read it before, just be prepared for some math.

   Once you have past linear algebra and multivariate calc you can start information theory.
