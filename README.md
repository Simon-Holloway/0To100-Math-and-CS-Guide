# The 0 To 100 Math and CS Guide



# Intro:
   This course assumes you know litterally nothing about math and computer science, and also assumes you want to become a great mathmaician and computer scientist. To get started just go to the math and computer science sections down below, the rest of the intro is how this guide came to be so if that sounds boring just skip it.

   Having seen and taken a lot of courses online for self studying now, I can confidently say most suck. Mainly speaking of MOOCs here, most I have seen are too verbose (to me) while lacking in practical applications, they start at too much of an entry level and don’t go too far in depth to be useful. They also seem to hang around beginner level which makes it hard wondering where to go to advance. 

   So I spent this year gathering the best courses and books I could find, shortening the list to what I think are only the necessities, and now I’m publishing it here. The goal of this guide is to become a competent mathematician and computer scientist as fast as possible while leaving nothing out. However long this takes will be up to you and your schedule, I have no timeframes.

   I did try my best to keep costs low and look for books with widespread availability. These books are not free, but will for sure cost less than a college education.

   I gutted these guides to make this one, 

   [/sci/ Wiki](https://4chan-science.fandom.com/wiki/Mathematics)
   
   [Open Source University](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science)
   
   [MIRI](https://intelligence.org/research-guide/)
   
    
   All are worth checking out for more options / other choices of books / other tangental fields of knowledge. 
   
   /sci/ and MIRI being the most helpful.
   
# General tips:

   
   Buy older editions of the book, usually they are MUCH cheaper and are not missing too much, some are worth it for the new addition. Use your discretion. 
      
   Don't worry about doing all the problems in a text book, just select a few to do and move on.
      
   Set yourself a goal for X amount of work a day. 20 pages a day will get a 500 page textbook done in under a month! consistancy is key.
   
   Don't worry if it's hard to study at first, think of your brain as a muscle that gets stronger the more you train it. Just keep trying and be realistically consistant.
    
    
# Math:
   **How to go through math:**
    
   Start with proofs, set theory, and precalc at the same time.
        
   Then go through calc and probability at the same time.

   Then do applied linear algebra, first PDE book, and real analysis at the same time.

   Finish with the last PDE book.




   **Required:**

**Pre-Calculus**
If you have been out of school for a while I highly suggest going to [Kahn Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math), starting at algebra 1 or further back if you need it, and working your way up through pre-calculus. It will make your life much easier than just diving into calc (which I did and it didn't work well because I didn't have a good foundation). 

      -tip: don’t watch the videos, they are too long, just do the test problems on the side and learn what your supposed to do if you get the problems wrong.
      its also useful to think about why what your learning is useful and try thinking about how you can apply it real life.
   

**Proofs:**

    How to Prove It: A Structured Approach by Velleman

**Intro Set theory**
        
    Elements of Set Theory by Enderton

**Calc Single Varite (also known as calc 1 & 2):**

    Calculus, Vol. 1: One-Variable Calculus, with an Introduction to Linear Algebra by Apostol

**Multivariate (calc 3):**
    
    Calculus, Vol. 2: Multi-Variable Calculus and Linear Algebra with Applications to Differential Equations and Probability by Apostol


**Applied Linear Algebra:**

    Linear Algebra and Its Applications by Strang 


**Probability and Statistics:**

    Probability and statistics Book by Morris H. DeGroot

**Partial Differential Equations (PDE):**

   Before Real analysis:

    Applied Partial Differential Equations: With Fourier Series and Boundary Value Problems by Haberman 
        
   After Real analysis:
        
    Partial Differential Equations by Evans
        

**Real analysis:**

    Zorich's Mathematical Analysis I & II
    

**Moving forward**:
    If you just can’t get enough math the next best areas to explore would most likely be number theory, abstract algebra to group theory, and random signals and noise.
    
    
# Comp-Sci
   **How to go through compsci:**
        
   Linearly focus on the C++ course to data structures and then algorithms. Once you have taken the C++ course and learned the data structures, take both a python course to learn syntax and the how computers work courses. Then read the algorithms book and implement them in C++ and Python. 

   Most of what is available for you to learn in computer science will be bottlenecked by your understanding of math, so do put in a good amount of your study time (however long you set for yourself) there.

   Once you understand proofs you can start reading theory of computation, you can read it before, just be prepared for some new looking math.

   Once you have past linear algebra and multivariate calc you can start information theory. Then on ML and AI which I will be adding soon.
