**ML Interviews**

[Introduction to Machine Learning Interviews Book](https://huyenchip.com/ml-interviews-book/)

   This is a great guide for people wanting to get a machine learning job in companies large or small. 
   It goes over different job types, timelines, and interview questions. It seems comprehensive and well thought out.

Not sure if this is still used or relevant, but Iâ€™m keeping it here.
